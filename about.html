        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What is a fake follower?</h2>
            <p>A fake follower is any account created for a reason other than normal Instagram use. This can be to inflate likes or followers, spam other users or collect data on other Instagram accounts. They are not your target customers.</p>

            <h2>How does Modash identify suspicious accounts?</h2>
            <p>In Modash, we identify three types of suspicious accounts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mass followers:</strong> These are accounts that follow 1k+ accounts. Could be your high school Greg who follows a bunch of accounts and is active on the platform once every 2 years. Get it together, Greg!</li>
                <li><strong>Suspicious mass followers:</strong> These are accounts that follow 1k+ accounts and the vibes are similar to bots & fakes.</li>
                <li><strong>Bots & fakes:</strong> These are accounts that are most likely bots and fakes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>How can you tell if an influencer has fake followers?</h2>
            <p>There are various signs such as missing or limited profile information, irrelevant or spammy comments, and unusual engagement patterns. Modashâ€™s fake follower tool scores profiles based on a number of criteria; those that score below the threshold are considered fake.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What percentage of Instagram followers are fake?</h2>
            <p>Every profile is different. Profiles with larger numbers of followers typically have a higher percentage compared to smaller profiles. Typically, anything above 25% could be a sign of fraud.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Should I work with influencers who have fake followers?</h2>
            <p>All influencers have some fake followers. Focus on the number of real followers in your target audience. If you find a creator with 25% fake followers, this alone is not enough information to make a decision. That same creator could have 500,000 followers, 75% of them are in your target city, age group, and gender and with a good engagement rate.</p>
